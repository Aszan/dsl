# Structurizr DSL cookbook

Creating software architecture diagrams from a textual definition is becoming more popular, but it's easy to introduce inconsistencies into your diagrams if you don't keep the multiple source files in sync. This cookbook is a guide to the Structurizr DSL, an open source tool for creating diagrams as code from a single consistent model.
